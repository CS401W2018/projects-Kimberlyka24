        <h3>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h3>
        <p>Inline CSS is applied directly on the HTML element. It only works on the single element it is implemented. Embedded CSS is a CSS written on the &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section. The good thing about embedded is you don't need an additional file. Lastly, External CSS is a CSS that is coded outside the HTML file and is only referenced through the use of &lt;link&gt; tag.
        </p>
        <h3>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h3>
        <p>One reason is that it makes it easier to maintain. Having HTML and CSS separate makes it easier to modify and update. Another one is reusability. If a style is shared among different HTML files, having one CSS to set the styles of all the HTML is convenient.</p>
        <h3>What is a selector used for?</h3>
        <p>A CSS selector is used to target specific elements in an HTML.</p>
