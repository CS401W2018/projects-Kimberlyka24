                <h3>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h3>
                <p>The difference between a block tag and an inline tag is that block tags are standalone tags, meaning they can start a new line, while inline tags are tags inside a tag. Examples of block tags are div, p, h1, ul, ol, etc. Exampls of inline tags are span, a, strong, etc.</p>

                <h3>What is normal flow in HTML</h3>
                <p>A normal flow of an HTML pertains to the default way of positioning elements in a webpage.</p>

                <h3>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
                <p>Float is a property in CSS used in positioning elements in a webpage. It is useful in styling a webpage. We need to clear the float to avoid the parent container from collapsing, to maintain consistency in the children elements inside a container.</p>

            <li>
                <h3>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
                <p>Absolute positioning means that the elements's position is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. Relative positioning is relative to its original location. Fixed positioning is relative to the viewport of the webpage.</p>

                <h3>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
                <p>I guess you can make it responsive by making a slight vibrate on the phone whenever the navigation buttons are pressed to simulate a touch feedback. You can make the button make a small zoom in-out animation. Lastly, we can make the button standout by using colors contrasting with the webpage.</p>
