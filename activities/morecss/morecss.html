                <h3>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h3>
                <p>The main difference between block and inline tags is that a block tag is written in a new line while an inline tag is written inside an existing line. Block tags are usually used in defining large parts of a webpage while inline tags are mostly used for styling parts of an element.</p>
