        <h3>What is the difference between absolute link and a relative link?</h3>
        <p>The difference between absolute link and relative link is that absolute links contains the whole web address and usually are external links while relative links are links that are within the same directory or same site the current page is located. So basically, we user absolute links for external links while we use relative links for links within the same site.</p>

        <h3>Three Rules with relative links</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A single dot &#40;.&#41; means the link is in the current folder</li>
            <li>A double dot &#40;..&#41; means it is in the parent folder</li>
            <li>A slash &#40;/&#41; means it starts at the root</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Do link always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h3>
        <p>It is not required for links to be inside the nav tag. Nav tag's purpose is to group links for navigation purposes, but not necessary to put all of the links there.</p>
