                <h3>How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class?</h3>
                <p>We shouldn't put too much time on engagement assignments after class. If we can do it around 15-20mins as long as we are able to answer the questions.</p>

                <h3>What should you focus on?</h3>
                <p>We should focus on learning along with everyone in class, participating on the lessons in class.</p>

                <h3>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h3>
                <p>The main difference between the two is that grids are used for more complex arrangements of elements in an html while flex are mostly used for simpler layouts. The best use-case would be to use the grid for the main layout, then yuse flex for the internal elements.</p>
