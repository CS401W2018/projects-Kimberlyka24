                <h3>What you learned about Flex and CSS?</h3>
                <p>I learned that a flex is used to arrange elements inside a container. It is similar to grid but grids is for containers while flex is for items inside the container.</p>

                <h3>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</h3>
                <p>An accessible website is a legal obligation in the US. Also, having a website with accessibility enables people with disability to use the website, leading to more users, improved user experience, and SEO benefits.</p>
