        <h4>List out the different ways to select an item.</h4>
        <p>The different ways to select an item are universal selctor &#40;*&#41;, type selector &#40;p, h1, etc.&#41;, class selector, id selector &#40;#&#41;, attribute selector, descendant selector, child selector, and many other more. Depending on the use-case, you can use some or all of them in a single css file.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h4>
        <p>Their are two main difference between ID and Class. The first is the syntax, ID uses asterisk &#40;#&#41; while class uses dot &#40;.&#41;. An ID can only be used once in a page while class can be multiple.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h4>
        <p>They are both used as a container. The difference is that DIV is used to group large sections of the HTML while SPAN is used for small portions of text in an HTML.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?</h4>
        <p>While HEADER, MAIN, and FOOTER are used to structure different parts of the webpage, DIV is flexible and can be used anywhere to group a big portion of an HTML.</p>
        <h4>What are the different ways to select a color?</h4>
        <p>The different ways to select a color in an HTML are using named colors &#40;such as red, blue, green, etc.&#41;, hexadecimal &#40;example: #ff5733&#41;, rgb, rgba, and many other more. They have different advantages like named colors are easy to code while hexadecimals are used to get more specific color space.</p>
