        <h3>Linear Switches</h3>
        <p>A <span>linear switch</span> is the simplest type of mechanical keyboard switch. When you press a linear switch, there is no clicking sound and no feedback. This type of switch is used for minimalists, especially the ones who don't want to disturb others while typing.</p>

        <img src="./Interest_and_Hero_Page_Images/Tactile.gif" alt="Tactile_Switch">
        <h3>Tactile Switches</h3>
        <p>A <span>tactile switch</span> is a switch that when clicked, makes a noticeable feedback. This feedback lets the user know that the key is registered. It doesn't create a noticeable sound, making it good for those who want to feel the key registered without disturbing others.</p>

        <img src="./Interest_and_Hero_Page_Images/Clicky.gif" alt="Clicky_Switch">
        <h3>Clicky Switches</h3>
        <p>A <span>clicky switch</span> is a switch that aside from providing a feedback when clicked, it also creates a noticeable sound. Clicky switches are usually the loudest types of mechanical keyboard switches that may annoy others as you type.</p>

        <h3>Relative Links vs Absolute links</h3>
        <p>A <span>relative link</span> is a type of link that is present relative to the path of the current page location. This type of link is usually used when navigating within the same site. An example of that would be this <a href="./profile_page.html">link</a> that sends you to my profile page.<br>
            An <span>absolute link</span> is a type of link that has a full URL. This is usually used when directing someone to an external link. An example of that would be this <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/gamer/keyboards/key-switch-types-101/?srsltid=AfmBOopFBuPLfx-1P--nlqCM2VCfDU5UD9J7P7hExJQhtglNL6S85sRU">link</a> that sends you to a website talking more about mechanical keyboards.</p>
