        <p>Walter L. Cherry is the founder of the Cherry Electrical Products Corporation &#40;now known as Cherry Corporation&#41;. His company started with making microswitches for machines like an arcade machine. 
            Around 1973, they started manufacturing computer keyboards, together with patenting the first keyboard switch. Around 1983, the company started the lineup of the MX key switches. Now, it is more commonly 
            known as the Cherry MX switches. Walter is a hero of sorts because if he did not founded the Cherry Corporation, we may never have these awesome keyboard switches.</p>
