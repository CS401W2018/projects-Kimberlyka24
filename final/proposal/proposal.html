            <li>
                <p>The title will be "World of Beyblade" and the topic is all about beyblades.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I chose this topic because beyblade is one of my childhood toys. I do have beyblades and stadium that I can take photos so I chose it for the conveniency of not having to rely getting photos on the internet. Also, I think it is a cool hobby that everyone should try.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The homepage will be just the introduction about beyblades. The other pages will be the history, table of the best-selling or most popular beyblades of all time, a short list of beyblades I have and descriptions, types of launchers used in spinning the beyblade, and the form page for voting for their favorite beyblade among the list.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In my form, I will collect their name, email address, age, and their chosen beyblade. The data on the table will be the best-selling or most popular beyblades of all time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For the images, I will take photos of my beyblades and launchers. If I will need other photos, I will make sure it has the common creative license to avoid copyright problems. For the info, I will use the official beyblade website and the beyblade wiki. Here are the links: <a href="https://beyblade.com/">Link 1</a> <a href="https://beyblade.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">Link 2</a></p>
